Thank you for downloading or buying this book Learning Prolog The Hard Way. Prolog first appeared in 1972 and was created by Alain Colmerauer. According to Wikipedia:

  Prolog has its roots in first-order logic, a formal logic, and unlike many other programming languages, Prolog is declarative: the program logic is expressed in terms of relations, represented as facts and rules. A computation is initiated by running a query over these relations. [WP01]_

Said in a slightly simpler way, Prolog has facts and rules with relationships. A `lion` and a `tiger` are related in many ways, either as `preditors`, `mammals` or as belonging to the genus `panthera`. These facts and rules are stored in a Knowledge Base and can be queried to get information out.

This book would not have existed without all the work of Zed Shaw, and it is to him I am truly grateful for making it easy to write this book.
